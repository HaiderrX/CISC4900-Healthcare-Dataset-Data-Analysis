# CISC4900-Healthcare-Dataset-Data-Analysis

This project is currently in development and follows a tentative plan for exploring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a healthcare dataset using **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **LaTeX**. The workflow is structured into phases to provide a clear roadmap from raw data to a professional final report.  

## Current Progress
- **Phase 1 (Ongoing): Data Cleaning and Transformation (Python)**  
  - Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and preparing features.  
  - Designing a relational schema using ERDPlus to guide database structure.  

## Project Phases

**Phase 1: Data Preparation and Schema Design**  
- Clean, preprocess, and validate the dataset using Python.  
- Perform transformations and preliminary exploratory analysis.  
- Build an entity-relationship diagram in ERDPlus.  
- Finalize the relational schema for database integration.  

**Phase 2: SQL Query Analysis**  
- Implement the database schema.  
- Develop SQL queries to extract insights, perform joins, and generate aggregates.  
- Document initial findings based on query outputs.  

**Phase 3: Dashboard Development (Power BI)**  
- Connect SQL results or cleaned dataset to Power BI.  
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs, trends, and comparisons.  

**Phase 4: Report Preparation (LaTeX)**  
- Compile methodologies, SQL analyses, and Power BI results.  
- Write a professional academic-style report supported by figures and tables.  

## Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset and transformation scripts (Python).  
- ER diagram and database schema.  
- SQL query set and documented insights.  
- Power BI dashboards.  
- Final written report (LaTeX).
