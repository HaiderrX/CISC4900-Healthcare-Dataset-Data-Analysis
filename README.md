# CISC4900-Healthcare-Dataset-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a healthcare dataset using a combination of **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **LaTeX** for a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow.  

## Project Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and **data transformation** to prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Use **SQL queries** to explore the dataset and extract meaningful insights.  
- Build **interactive dashboards in Power BI** to communicate findings visually.  
- Document the project and findings in a **LaTeX-written report** for professional presentation.  

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data wrangling, cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn).  
- **SQL**: Querying the dataset, aggregations, joins, and analysis in relational database form.  
- **Power BI**: Creating dashboards and visualizing key metrics and insights from the analysis.  
- **LaTeX**: Generating a structured, professional report for academic or industry use.  

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)**  
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.  
   - Transform data types and create new derived features.  

2. **SQL Query Analysis**  
   - Write and execute queries to extract summary statistics and relationships.  
   - Optimize queries for performance and clarity.  

3. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**  
   - Connect SQL results or cleaned dataset to Power BI.  
   - Build visualizations to highlight trends, comparisons, and KPIs.  

4. **Report Writing (LaTeX)**  
   - Summarize findings with supporting figures and tables.  
   - Present analyses, methodologies, and conclusions in academic style.
